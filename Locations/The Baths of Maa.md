![[The Baths of Maa.png]]
- Once a palace for the [[House Maa]], an extinct group of Slug-men
- Recently rediscovered. Shady activity in area.
- Location is _not_ common knowledge
- [[Deepit]]  discovered, but has not investigated.
- Looks as though some vegetation has been cut away, not as many bushes in front


Carvings of slug-men faces all over the place. Almost all eye-stalks snapped off. Many defaced.
Several basins with open slug mouths above them, no long working. Basins filled with dust
