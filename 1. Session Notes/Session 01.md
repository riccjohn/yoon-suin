Staying at [[The Humble River Hotel]], in [[The Yellow City]], right next to old imperial bridge (titanic structure made of purple glass and steel - forgotten relic)

Were introduced to [[Deepit]] 

[[Deepit]] leads us (Mon Oct 2) over bridge, into the [[The Old City]]
Leads us to stone portal jutting out from a hill. Doorway and pile of stone.

We go to open N door, bucket on top of door falls, green liquid comes out and splashes out. Sizzles when it hits 10' pole. Moisture in wood evaporates

Create with amphibious body, colorful red frills, almost like an elizabethan collar. Multiple creatures

One looks up, unarmed "What doing?"

Axolotl men -  Cacigan - lesser, primitive race. Commonly believed to be part of reincarnation cycle - lived 

Seems disinterested "You gamble?" "Got tokens?" "Betting on crab men fight"

## Room 5

- W wall - center - faint outline of a door in masonry, no handle
	- Door has hinges, would swing in, but no way to grab/open, maybe from other side?
- N door - same slugman noble from Room 5. No longer treading, has grabbed naked human by hair and is holding mace up in air, ready to smite his captive
- 

We try opening chest, bars drop down from ceiling, blocking our escape, hear steps of the talker from the gambling encounter. Walks up to bars and shakes his head "You _are_ a gambler aren't you?" Then turns around and walks away. [[Pham Unmesh]] shoots him with bow an arrow in back
