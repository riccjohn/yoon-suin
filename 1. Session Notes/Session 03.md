Starting in [[The Humble River Hotel]]

We have 2 docs from [[The Baths of Maa]]
- Written in cypher

We head to [[The Slumbering Snail]] opium den to meet [[Deepit]] to ask him about letters (thinking it might be thieves' cant)

- [[Deepit]] and [[Malaba]] sit inside, smoking a hookah
- We sit down with them
- [[Malaba]] returns with [[Purple Opium]]
- [[Deepit]] says "Sure, I can read it. The question is what's the information worth to you? 100 tokens"
 
Accounting note is a record keeping track of opium, [[Nectar]], token, and how much people are paid:
- porters
- boatmen
- workers - artisan / employee

- Covers 1000's of tokens-worth of payments
- [[Deepit]] does not know what [[Nectar]] is
- Initialed by [[AT]]

Second letter

- Set to meet __today__ at [[The Dried Pool]]
- [[Deepit]] recognizes symbol as the [[Order of the Golden Serpent]]

---

We hire [[Damodar]] and head to [[The Baths of Maa]], with [[Deepit]] leading us

Set out at 8AM, takes 2hrs to get there

**Things have changed outside**
- Area looks more cleared out by axes or machetes, trees knocked down, brush cut away
- Smoke pouring up staircase (like from campfire)

We go into other entrance by the Mango Tree. It's inhabited by half-shrimp, half-monkey creatures.

Room 10
- [[Ravani Velshak]] starts walking over the lines in the floor
- When [[Ravani Velshak]] finishes walking over pattern, ends in center of North wall and hear clicking noise and small niche / alcove opens. Inside, is a [[Masterwork Smoking Pipe]]
- [[Aasan Rhal]] smokes the [[Purple Opium]] from the [[Masterwork Smoking Pipe]]
	- They start having visions (the same vision)
	- Genderless child - something holy about them - glowing, smiling
	- People, things, riches are drawn to the child
	- Feel overwhelming sense of awe
	- At peak of vision, smile cracks and child suddenly has too many eyes, arms, legs, etc. Takes on aspect of a spider
	- Feel rage and hatred for this turn of events
	- Know this thing you loved wants to kill / possess you
	- Tied experience may be tied to the pipe itself

We head South to room 7
We notice that in room 15, the Mechanical Man we killed last session is gone - dragged away

In 7, go to E door "Catacombs of Maa" etched on it
- push open door, see man screaming, running to South in 16 - holding torch
- Blur of Axolotl men chasing him, armed with clubs

We give chase to the [[Axolotl-Men]], in hopes of saving the human

Run into 18

10 [[Axolotl-Men]] inside, have cornered a human in chainmail, wearing a black turban with silver emblem on it ([[Zon]]). Holding pole-arm, sweating and breathing heavily. Looks defeated until he sees the 6 of us - eyebrows perk up in expression of hope

Axolotl-Men wielding torches, clubs, axes - all unarmored

#combat

We cast "sleep" and 4 of them are asleep

We kill them all except one - last one drops to its knees "mercy mercy!"

[[Zon]] pushes last one to ground and gags him with cloth. Asks if we've seen his students around
- robes, 18-20 yrs old
- students from 'the academy'

We ask what he did to disturb the [[Axolotl-Men]]
- "They didn't take too kindly to me taking this" - opens up fold in robe revealing squishy-looking egg
- "for research purposes, you understand"
- a little smaller than basket ball
- says there's a dry pool a few chambers back and has a number of these eggs in bottom - a spawning pit. The [[Society of the Many Tongues]] paid me handsomely to lead an expedition here to learn the [[Axolotl-Men]] language
- He leaves

[[Deepit]] rifling through pockets of the dead Axolotl

#loot 
- 8 tokens
- 5 clubs
- 5 slings
- 30 sling missiles

Left with bound [[Axolotl-Men]]
[[Aasan Rhal]] wants to speak to him - we pull him in

[[Ravani Velshak]] asks if he wants us to help him get it back, but he doesn't seem to believe we'd help

We hear shouting from the direction of the catacombs - [[Zon]] and another voice in disagreement
- We head back towards the catacombs (16)
- [[Zon]] shouting into room 7 at a few men in robes with striking yellow sash
	- "I'm exempt from a tax, I already paid on my way in"
	- sees us "Oh I think they haven't paid their tax, I must be on my way"
	- He offers them the egg, but they want more
	- "Very well, I will pay my own tax but I do not know these roustabouts"
	- Tosses the men a sack of 200 tokens
	- [[Ravani Velshak]] tells them [[Zon]] is rich, he should give more, including the egg
	- Acts as if he's fishing egg out of pack, but turns and pushes door open
		- 2 men in yellow closest to him attack him and follow him into room 7
		- [[Zon]] seems to be moving very fast
		- They shoot slings at him
		- He's leaving a trail of blood
		- [[Ravani Velshak]] puts an iron spike in the ground to lock the door to room 7

We look in sarcophagus labeled [[Ban-Maa]] (which was mentioned by [[Ofu, Lord of Ablutions]])
- Slid heavy marble lid aside and drop to ground
- A slug-man in opulent purple robes sits up wide-eyed and looks around
- Says "Ah, good. Bring me to the Emperor's Palace, slaves!"
