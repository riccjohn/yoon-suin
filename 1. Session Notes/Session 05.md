# Session Notes
Starting with [[Joshi]] at [[The Humble River Hotel]]

[[Joshi]] brings us up to his apartment an explains:
Walled garden, abandoned by [[House Aihono]] , in [[Red Hill District]] meant to be a lover's garden. Abandoned for unknown reason 20-ish years ago

Believes [[House Aihono]] signet ring is in garden

## Walled Garden

- As we head up an alleyway - huge 10' tall cross between rhino & ape with 4 arms, covered in fur, (naked), steps in front of our path and bellows "Heading to the walled garden, are you?"
	- Demon
- We tell him we are
- He grins and points "If you bring me that signet ring, I'll make it worth your while. Idk what they're paying you, but I promise I can pay an even greater sum" - points towards a ruined library
- 4 30' towers made of pink limestone
- pink walls 20' high making a square shape
- large iron gate facing road
- vines and trees nearby, hanging off wall
- bars of gate wrapped in chains, locks. Deadbolt and bar on inside, holding shut
- [[Abon]] and [[Phoung]] take beetle and ride round

- East side of wall - hear laughing, drums, pipes, stream entering
- North side - Small iron door
- West side - stream exiting - waist-high iron grate
- Looking through front gate
	- East - pavilion of finely carved stones, art on friezes within
	- Center - Round pond, hear stream beyond
	- other structures, wildly overgrown with exotic flora, large flying insects (hand-sized beetles, dragonflies, etc)

	- top of wall feels sharp, gritty, waxy
		- Mortar is embedded with broken glass
		- Need gloves to climb up
	- Sees garden full of red flowers and fruits
	- Statue of woman with tentacles for arms, wearing silver necklace with jewels

Ways inside:
- Over wall
- Bend bars at 15 (near red garden) or 16 (near people) (into stream)

We yank the bars off at 15, but it's loud

- Entering through stream
	- sweet smells, manure, exotic
	- 30-40' in front, a bridge that goes over stream
		- red, wooden, intricately carved
		- Movement near bridge in foliage
	- stream gets deeper and wider after passing through wall. Landscaped
- We head to 10 - red garden

### Red Garden
- Archway, inscription in slug-men language
	- "From Passion, Cruelty"
- Winding pathway that leads to circular lawn in center, 30' in diameter
	- in center of lawn, statue of naked human woman. Instead of arms, vines covered in thorns. Wearing silver necklace with 5 pendants - each containing a large opal gemstone
- We try to burn the flowers, but instead of burning, they turn red hot and heat up like metal. Almost drawn into it - they seem to "like" it
	- [[Red Hot Poker]]

- [[Loq Belsong]] attempts to grab the necklace
- Statue begins to come to life and says "I love you, I love you, I love you" and reaches out and tries to embrace him with vine arms - 8 dmg
- #combat 
- Flowers appear to begin to heat up, including the flowers that some of us picked
- [[Loq Belsong]] attempts to flee but statue says "Please don't leave me!" and grabs him, pulling him in, snapping his neck - dealing 3 damage - He dies #death 
- [[Abon]] flings stone towards her but she hisses at him "Get over here!"
- We keep damaging statue, but now the flowers are starting to catch the surrounding foliage ablaze
- Final shot at her damages her, she turns back to stone and falls backwards. Flames go out instantly. Plants still smolder nearby
	#loot 
	- Silver necklace with 5 opals

We move towards the fountain (6)
- Pool filled with lilies and duckweed, huge koi-fish
	- Rather than eyes on side of head, eyes on top, gazing skyward
	- 20-30 koi fish see us approach, crowd up near party, as if expecting to be fed
- In center of pool, small stone plinth
	- statue of a small rhinoceros
	- within mouth, bright blue rose - not organic - maybe glass

[[Phoung]] sprinkles ration crumbs. Fish seem excited, but then quickly seem disinterested by it

[[Ravani Velshak]] backtracks to get [[Loq Belsong]]'s body to see if the fish are interested in it
- We find a woman hunched over the body, rifling through his possessions - it is [[La-Lo]]
- We drag the body back to the fountain
- Fish seem excited

- Wearing thin veil over face, like beekeeper
- Toward onion-domed building (5) "Belvedere", hear faint laughing, pipe music
- We ask him what he does here
	- I garden, hand the ladies flowers, keep this place looking the way it does
	- "What ladies?" "The Bride - she's no longer with us, but we swore an oath to maintain this place"
	- We ask if there is any guard here - he says no
- He has no nose?
- "Be sure to stop and smell the flowers"
