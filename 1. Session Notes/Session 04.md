- Wake up "Ah slaves, bring me to the Imperial Palace at once. I have business to take care of"
	- We know there _is_ no imperial palace
	- No emperor for 100's of years at least
- We tell him that there hasn't been an emperor in recent memory, no palace, but we'd like to assist him
- Very well, [[The Purple Bank]], then

### The Yellow City

Time: Noon

[[The Purple Bank]] is in [[Pinnacle Heights]] - would be fastest to charter a boat
[[Ban-Maa]] doesn't really recognize the city / river - says it has changed

[[Deepit]] says "[[Malaba]] would be very interested in the pipe you're smoking. We should stop and see him on the way" to [[Ravani Velshak]]

Takes 4 hours

We stop at [[The Slumbering Snail]] to chat with [[Malaba]]

[[Malaba]]'s eyes go wide when he sees the pipe "That's the [[Sebsi]]" - pipes imbued with energies
Malaba fills it with [[Black & Gold]] opium
- Smokers have visions
	- shared vision
	- immobile, in cave or dark place, chained / bound, fire burning behind you, can only see shadow dancing on wall in front of you, you know this place is church/temple. Shadow begins to grow, morph, writhe. Two arms become 4, 6, 8, etc. Shadow takes on aspect of a great spider. While afraid, you also feel irreverence, like the temple is for whatever is casting this shadow - a holy being. It does not want you casting your eyes upon it, but only its shadow.
- Malaba says "Far out!" Says he interprets dreams and says there's something to this that's connected to us
- Wants pipe for 400 tokens #loot 
- Says he'll let us smoke from it from time to time
- He believes that the visions have less to do with pipe than with the person who's smoking it. Somehow, we're connected to this aspect of a spider

We move through the [[Red Hill District]] 

- We hear drums and pipers, smell sandalwood
- See procession of priests - some slugmen, mostly humans
- Wearing strange hats - kind of make them look like slug-men

	- Slug-men being carried on boards
	- [[Ravani Velshak]] and [[Abon]]
		- eyes begin to water from smell of incense, pungent odor
		- coughing fit
		- [[Aspirants]] - say "The Sign, The Sign! They're showing the sign! You are primed to be reborn as slug-men all you need to do is repent!"
		- We ignore them "Seek us out in the [[Temple District]]"
		- Hands us each a pamphlet with ruined land and deep canyon with flames at the bottom, beautiful perfect land on other side of canyon

	- Largest [[Cockroach Clansmen]] says "They butchered one of our roaches and feasted on the flesh. Now we aim to get that flesh back"
	- The humans say "Lies! Help us!"

	- Hours go by, returns with several slug-men dressed in finery, humans, porters, guards with spears, 
	- He has changed his clothes into something more modern - robe with woven patterns, small black fashionable hat
	- Gestures at porters, which walk up to each of us and give us each as sack with 500 tokens each #loot 
	- Hands us a scroll, gestures at human with skin dyed purple - [[Joshi]] - explains that he'll be a go-between for us and [[Ban-Maa]] in the future
	- One of slugmen lifts a flag over head, steel flying boat lands on ground, doors open, [[Ban-Maa]] "Thank you again, enjoy this ride back to your hotel. Please do be in touch. I would like to be reacquainted with [[House of Aihono]] in the coming days"
